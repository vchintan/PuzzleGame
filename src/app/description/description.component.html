    <p>This application finds the optimal solution to solve a 8 or
      15-puzzle. By optimal solution, we mean a solution requiring the
      minimum numbers of moves.</p>

    <p>
      Different algorithms are implemented : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth
      First Search</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_star">A*</a>
      or <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=Iterative+deepening+A*">Iterative
      Deepening A* (IDA*)</a>. You can use and compare these algorithms only
      for the 8-puzzle. Indeed, only IDA* are able to resolve a 15-puzzle
      relatively fast and without consuming too much memory.
    </p>

    <p>A* and IDA* algorithms use heuristic function to find the
      optimal solution. Three heuristic functions are proposed : Manhattan
      Distance, Linear Conflict and Database Pattern.</p>

    <p>This web application is deployed on Google App Engine infrastructure (Frontend Instance Class F2 : 1200MHz,
      256 MB). The algorithm has 60 seconds to solve the puzzle.</p>

    <p>
      The code is open-sourced and can be found <a
